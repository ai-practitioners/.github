# Hello, world!

## What is ai-practitioners?

We're a group of like-minded AI Engineers-to-be. And we're very forthcoming in sharing learning resources and learning from each other.

This is a private Organization for potential [AIAP](https://aisingapore.org/innovation/aiap/) hopefuls to practice our git-skills. Part of the skilling we want to practice is using all that Github has to offer, in a safe environment where we are free to make mistakes:
- branching
- creating issues and closing them via commits
- pull requests
- writing in markdown
- resolving merge conflicts
- git best practices
- and so many more.

It is for the members of AI Learners Discord server run by JF Koh.


## How to request access?

If you'd like to participate, send me ( @ellacharmed ) either via Discord DM or other group chats where I'm a part of or email me ( same username at gmail.com ), with the following information.

Please provide your 
- discord nickname
- github username
- email address <br/>
in your DM/email, so I can add you and sent Calendar invites when we organize a vid-call via Google Meet or Zoom.


## How to participate?

Our methodology so far (we're trying things out as we learn) is to create a branch and do our edits in that branch and then merge if after resolving (any) `merge conflicts`.

You're welcome to share as much as you deem appropriate, keeping in mind some of us have yet to submit the Tech Assessment. So if you're already an accepted AIAP applicant, you're _welcomed_ (even _encouraged_) not to commit a full Tech Assessment-type of notebooks) by utilizing the `.gitignore` feature to exlude individual notebooks or even whole folders.


Welcome aboard!
